# Hello, my name is **Sarah Guitart** and I am a first semester Master's student in the *ECo Department*


# I am excited to learn the following items:

1. What modeling means and how to build a model from scratch 
2. How to use statistics in environmental research and conservation
3. How to make pretty graphs 



# This is my first semester, so some of the classes I really enjoyed from my graduate certificate through Oregon State University were:

* Antarctic Science
* Avian Conservation and Management 
* Wildlife Management
